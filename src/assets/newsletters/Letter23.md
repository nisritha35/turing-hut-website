On 10th August, we bid farewell to another outstanding batch of final-year students (TH 2k22-2k24) who have been instrumental in shaping the Turing Hut that we know today. Their unyielding determination, remarkable vision, and profound valor have made Turing Hut an amazing place for nurturing new talents and hosting exhilarating events. As we celebrate the memories we share and all the achievements we've accomplished, we recognize the honesty and capability with which they worked. We look forward to maintaining their legacy by stepping into their shoes with all that we've learned from them, and hope to take Turing Hut to even greater heights. We wish them all the very best in their new and exciting endeavors, as their journey will continue to inspire and guide us.

- **Quantum Memory: Single-Photon X-ray Storage** <br/>An international research team, including Texas A&M University professor Dr. Olga Kocharovskaya, has achieved a breakthrough in quantum memory technology by successfully storing and releasing X-ray pulses at the single-photon level. This innovation marks the first realization of quantum memory in the hard X-ray range and holds significant potential for future X-ray quantum technologies. The experiment, conducted at synchrotron facilities in Germany and France, utilizes a novel protocol involving nuclear absorbers to form a frequency comb, enabling the storage of quantum information with the potential for longer memory times and applications in quantum information processing. The team's findings are published in [Science Advances.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240809135907.htm)

- **Aquatic Robots: Bacteria-Powered Technology** <br/> Researchers at Binghamton University have developed a groundbreaking self-powered aquatic robot that skims across water using bacteria-powered biobatteries. This innovative technology could revolutionize aquatic robotics, enabling autonomous nodes to function even in challenging ocean environments. The robot's unique design uses a Janus interface to harness energy from water, powering its movements and sensors that can track vital environmental data. With potential applications in monitoring pollution, marine life, and more, the team is now focused on optimizing bacteria for energy production in harsh ocean conditions. This could be a major leap forward for the future of autonomous aquatic systems.For more details, check out the full article [here](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240729173341.htm).
